## freshly pressed words

Welcome to the machine, happy E, been there done that, now we are adapting it to the new world order. Suck up that sweet, sweet ore, smash it through a front end wet thing and fire it out of the server into a browser you care nothing about, full of ads you want to blub to death with a spoon.

### the weasel

I came home from a taxing day of trying to get FUCKING wordpress to press fucking words into nice HTMLs and CSSs and Javacups. Three people were watching some poor carpenter replacing the front door handle with a combo lock (eliminating the need for a key), while also adding a new lock as an added bonus so we don't get violated in our sleep by the Tokyo Drift Club, Galleria edition. So, really all that will happen is next Friday things might be slightly slowdermilked.

I also had to ask for money so I can keep this server alive, so three people and some people from my bridge cribbage can snack on a badgers rift! Wait? Fuck! Why did you have to say that!
Also why I have the donate thing, just in case you are special flower and enjoy my flavour of fertilizersand would like to gobble some down.

### a threat?

I mean, thoughts of the ole ultra violence were causing through my veins until I start firing out keys into the night, slicing through this literary mess like hot fondue and spraying it all over the back wall of the space unit. I should probably meditate on that.

Hows the P R O G R A M going?

I'll finish on this:

Fuck knows what I was thinking with 240km in a month.
It has just occurred to me that pokemon-go was boosting my weekly walking numbers into dangerous territory, so dangerous I began to believe.

### oh 244! reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally

Thats fine, I have got this!
Thank you for all that have supported Orange Sky with me, essentially paying to watch me dance like everyone is watching, you twisted little unicron. 

I want to believe and not harm people, this is my medicines, these are their stories, or not... I don't care. Get a new one!

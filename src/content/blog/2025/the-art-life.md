## The Arts, with Sir David Lynch

Apparently today (at the time of writing this anyway) would have been his 79th birthday, the universe could not wait that long.

Imaginary-friend-01: "A dead celeb?" I hear you caw.

jimbob: "almost definately"

Imaginary-friend-01: "but my last house was made out of dead celeb pelts and that melted into an on-coming floss-wagon."

jimbob: "okay, weirdo..."

### Mulholland

David Lynch is a bit special, his blending of pure evil and darkness with the ordinary everyday shit was something that stopped me in my tracks and is something I have tried to carry with me.

Underneath the surface there can lurk such evil.

Then there is his first feature film, [Eraserhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserhead) which just smokes you up and spits you out as a neatly collectable David Lynch fanboy plushie. Don't watch it if you are feeling particulary vunerable though, it may give your the psychosis. He had already cemented an unforgetable style in film direction and sound design that would leave you slightly brain damaged and wanting more. Apparently a fave of Stanley Kubrick too.

Watching the latest Dune adaptation reminded me of Lynch's ambitious take on the book—though challenging to condense. Trying to cram all that narrative into one feature length film would be almost impossible, it remains a classic in my eyes and ears.

I don't profess to be a film buff/critic of any sort but I know what I like and I like David Lynch movies and lets not forget serials, totally [Twin Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks).

I think he would be residing somewhere between the black and the white lodge, let's call it the grey lodge. Or maybe he will be back in a new human meat suit, coming to a video store near you!

That is enough from my face-fingers.

I really admired his tireless work and attention to details. Rest in ... or just keep going. ❤️

##  amandy scandy and the electric light section

Carl Jung seems to have written quite a bit on analysing drinks.... no.. . dreams, drinking in dreams is scary, but I just had a dream about Leonard Cohen moving into the Ocean Reef area so he could live in comfort and eat grilled lamb with Greek salads until the end of his days, but you know what fucked things up for old Leo C!? Bunnings! Leonard Cohen moved into Ocean Reef and decided to take down Bunnings because they had a monopoly over the home hardware market in Ocean Reef, well. . . all over WA I guess, hell, in my dream they even had their hand in life insurance for some reason.
The point is, drinking dreams are terrifying for a person who has chosen to be a sober. I don't know what the fuck is to be concluded from my little Leonard dreaming though, what say you, Carl?

## pitchfork dilemmas

After speaking with my local team, I now know what that noise is, good job everyone, go back to sleep!
I don't have a team, although I have a nice yacht named Steven Formaldehyde the Third which I occasionally mow down the local peasantry with while going for my morning walk.
It is nice to enjoy the finer things in life, the only way I can sustain this ridiculous lifestyle is by stealing money and accepting bribes, which brings me to this!

Helps me pay for a virtual piece of real estate and keep my blimp fed.
HP [Sauce](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=FBtuMSKPgao&si=M7bi0TibGAftwGqj), your will not mine!

I have been Diploming my fucking tits off in the first few weeks of semester two and so far so good, but I'll be fucked if I can get my head around this new JavaScript guy, he is good value, but I really have trouble keeping up.
Doesn't he know I cooked me noodles in a deep-fry situation, it almost been a year. I'm fine to serve that boiled tyre with a side of mango now, order up! *ding*

Almost there. . .

I am just looming in the shadows in that one.
This crappy drawing of a cow is a better representation of where I am at. Like, subscribe and donate so I can swan around on my yacht learning how to be drawn as a French girl.

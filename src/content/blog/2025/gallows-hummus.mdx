## about time

Just when you think you have enough time you find out the time robbers are on the prowl and you could lose it all while playing time-poker down the local refractory. 
I thought I knew time once, then I fell into a deep well and had my time sliced up into bits, never to be seen again.

This is all to say, I have no clue what I am talking about, and you have made it this far without pulling your own skeleton out and throwing it at a window, or have you? Good job! either way, top effort and points for trying.

### now I just have this shirt that doesn't fit

If I had a point for every time I tried a thing, I would have 9 points!
I was going to put some effort into this, then I sat down and really thought hard about it, I am just going to do my usual and smash things out like I don't care, let’s be honest I don't care, I am just here for the free hummus and the chance to throw a few skeletons.

### zorba and mixmasters

I finally figured out how to do this blogging thing from my portable device, snip snip, chop chop -  BWAHAHABBAAAHAHA, excellent, glad you approve.

More madness from the wet galley, grateful to have accepted I can do more than just write gratefulness, I wish people would stop butchering on public transportation though, real problems with that.
Shine the womble lamp!

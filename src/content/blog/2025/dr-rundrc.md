## Perth Daily Reflections audio-only meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous

![shadow bun](/img/2025/shadow_bun.png)

### Pre-meeting set-up

Arrive to set-up 15 mins beforehand to allow for any login/tech issues.
(If a designated host has not opened the meeting by 6.50am, any member who has previously hosted may login to start the meeting.)

### Login and start meeting

1. Login to Zoom using
User ID ~~redacted~~, passcode ~~redacted~~
*If Zoom asks for a code at login, which sometimes happens if you’re logging in from somewhere other than your usual IP address, you will need to access a one-time access code from the email account, password is also ~~redacted~~
2. Join Daily Reflection Meeting using: Meeting ID 82166401300 and passcode ~~redacted~~

### Apply Zoom meeting settings (via ‘host tools’)

1. Host settings

- In ‘host settings’ uncheck all permissions except ‘unmute’ and ‘chat’ so people can talk before the 7am start.
- The ‘rename’ function can be hijacked by bombers but it also lets people change their own names, restrict at host discretion.

### Chat

- Set chat to ‘everyone’ by clicking the chat icon then the 3 dots (…) to stop direct messages.
- If there are a few unknown attendees that look ‘interesting’, group suggestion is to set chat to ‘host and co-host’ only for the first half of the meeting then open it up to ‘everyone’ later when things settle. (For context bombing can include unmuting and having porn on in the background, trying to start their video, again with porn on, and using the rename function to be offensive, yes, the mind boggles.)
- Copy and paste Daily Reflection into chat from [https://www.aa.org/daily-reflections](https://www.aa.org/daily-reflections) continue to post as needed noting that attendees can only see messages in chat from the time they enter the meeting.

### Allocate co-hosts

It’s good to have one or more co-hosts to

- Admit people into the meeting
- Copy and paste the daily reflection into chat during the meeting
- Monitor the chat
- Welcome any newcomers and post relevant information
- Post the 7th tradition details

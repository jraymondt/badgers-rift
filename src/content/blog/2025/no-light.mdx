## no blight in the levitation of day
 
Let's see if blogging still works...  
Writing words is not something that I consider a part of my thing, but I have chosen to do it anyway. 
It has been nice to have a moment to reflect, daily, almost like a daily reflection. 
I need to get back to the codes and dip my nose in the broken ceramic stand, see what all the pottering is about.

### the fairy bread trail mixer 

Other such word salads that are mixed whilst warm to give a nice salmony aftertaste. 

Productive TAFE holiday so far, healthy, exercise, and gearing myself up for starting a small(me) web business but also looking for work when I get to the end next semester. 
It will be a race to the death! Who will profit from death first?

BBQ the trail and walk the salad, there and back to see how far it was. 
I was approximately 1.5 salads from the bar, which is a long way to walk in the cold day of dry July. 

### the sleeper must awake 

Sleep is nice, I have been somewhat catching up with that, but I also have been in a self-imposed hibernation for about 25 years. The thawing out process is slow and littered with the occasional ice block that I have to melt with a can of hairspray and a lighter. 
A quarter of a century of hibernation, and now I am starting to wake up and smell the artificial flowers.

Great things have happened this year already, and the nice little thing I do with some of my spare time also says that if I keep putting my best foot forward and embracing the winter sun, I will thaw to an acceptable flesh burning temperature. 
The promises are starting to solidify in and around Jimbob's head, I am starting to see the light at the mid-section of the sandworm. 

Thanks for hanging around.

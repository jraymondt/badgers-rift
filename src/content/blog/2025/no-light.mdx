## daylight

Let's see if blogging still works. 
Writing words is not something that I consider a part of my thing, but I have chosen to do it anyway.
It has been nice to have a moment to reflect, daily, almost like a daily reflection.
I need to get back to the codes and dip my nose in the broken ceramic stand, see what all the pottering is about.

### the fairy bread trail mixer

And other such word salads that are mixed together whilst warm to give a nice salmony aftertaste.
BBQ the trail and walk the salad, there and back to see how far it was.
I was approximately 1.5 salads from the bar, which is a long way to walk in the cold of dry july.

## Daily refelction

wow. . . I was so caught up in hosting mode this morning I didn't take time to read this properly... now that I am distracted. It's quite powerful and indictive of the day and challenges faced.

## OPENING UP TO CHANGE

<blockquote>
June 08

Self-searching is the means by which we bring new vision, action, and grace to bear upon the dark and negative side of our natures. With it comes the development of that kind of humility that makes it possible for us to receive God's help. . . . we find that bit by bit we can discard the old life — the one that did not work — for a new life that can and does work under any conditions whatever.

*AS BILL SEES IT, pp. 10, 8*

I have been given a daily reprieve contingent upon my spiritual condition, provided I seek progress, not perfection. To become ready for change, I practice willingness, opening myself to possibilities of change. If I realize there are defects that hinder my usefulness in A.A. and toward others, I become ready by meditating and receiving direction. "Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely" ( Alcoholics Anonymous,  p. 58). To let go and let God, I need only surrender my old ways to Him; I no longer fight, nor do I try to control, but simply believe that, with God's help, I am changed and affirming this belief makes me ready. I empty myself to be full of awareness, light, and love, and I am ready to face each day with hope.

Holy shit, I started editing some of the Daily Reflection! Let go!

### love

Thank you, all the people who put, up with my crazy self-obsession, I feel like a burning white-hole now, barely creating, but trying, there is something in the way and I just need to let go.
I am grateful for the support and understanding from all those around me, you know who you are, you listen to my rants, you put up with my self-obsession, you give me space to be myself, and you help me see the light when I am lost and swimming in open water.

Thank you for another day sober and another day of progress, change and trying to work out balance. Thank you, universe, of white-hot love consciousness, HP source code, "God is inside you and all around you" (I think I stole that last bit from the movie ('Stigmata')) [see bear](#pilot-bear)

I have been stuck in a teenage angst playlist, in this stage of my development, there is web development. Something I wish I had embraced at that age; it was all around me and I thought I was not capable of learning. Now I am living a dream, I am seeking help from an employment agency and a small business solutions type people, see I don't even know what I am doing, I am just doing. Feels right, I shall continue and try to get out of the way.

One day at a time I am learning little bits and pieces, how it all fits.

Just let go and let God, I am ready for change.  ..

### final thoughts

If the ketamine fuelled billionaire meme-womble that WAS in the white house can fire projectiles at the moon, I can probably make web development or similar work for me. I just need to let go of the old ideas. Maybe even come up with a business plan like an adult. Oh fuck, I could ask my cousin about starting his business, holy shit!? . . .

This has been some epic release of mind slop, if you made it this far you will be awarded a medal of honour, from our:

## it the ween wollow knight weave

Do you have your inappropriately tight sandwitches in a row?
Then we will begin...
I haven't even checked if I have been getting at least one of these rambling nonsense letters posted to myself, off, in the mail, at least once a moon.
Have I lost you already? Well wake up! We have all had enough of your nonsense, heretical banjo sound-cards.

Some of you seem to think I have nothing better to do than to flip flop from sunshine to sham-wow, well I have news for you and I am very important, busy and the rest.
So to all the nay-sayers and armless tortelli, go fuck yourself!
That is right, get your filthy mitts off my sauce, I AM BUSY MAKING WEB HISTORY!
Well. . . at least learning how to make a web out of said source.

Look at this, this is what I slave over why you fuck around with toenail clippings and your web-5.5 AI crypto-cakes.

### some may say I seem a tad stressed

I AM FINE HERETIC!
Bet you've never seen the inside of a combine webharvester, I didn't think so!
OK, maybe I am a bit stressed. Thankfully I have the support of my thousands of adoring fans and at least 2 distant cousins. I do have a picture of a person I pretend is my friend, really they have been dead for decades, I find these sorts of friendships much easier and flufilly, yep, lost the abillybubble to words. I am sure it will pass.

Please enjoy this picture, you can pretend it is me, take it to the park with you next time you go clubbing.

Jesus, I just happened to read some of my text words from a previous one of these love letters, HOT SPEW! Filth.
Lucky this one is much better and full of inspiring lyrical wisdom.
Absolutely no spokey dokeys.

### just a hollow moon

Why the flipping fuck am I filling up my SSD with this garbage, I thought I had a porpoise! Turns out I had a horny dolphin, (love you Chealsea) this milk crate, a fancy spoon that connects to the internet and plays music through even fancier plates, look! there goes the fucking MOON... TART!

Yeah I give up, I am busy pushing myself through a metal playdough set into a god shaped hole called TAFE, so I can get a job being a very fancy man with 2 plates and a can of corned cow cartilage.

## so, we are still here

You are reading this line, interesting choice.

Personally I would have started here, then force-fed my opinion to the masses via an Instagram troll named Gérard Pamplemousse.

### resolve this, turd burger

Speaking of being killed low flying by grapefruit, I was asked last night what my new years resolution would be? Well, my answer: "just keep doing what I have been doing".

Not sufficient said my old pal this morning, you need GOALS.

I think I finished the book [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) while I was in Hollywood Clinic for what I hope and think to be the last time as an Alcohol Detox Patient. One of the main take aways from that book (there are many) is to not set anything too over the top/unachievable just change your habits overtime, if you have a morning routine, stick to that and just add things that are manageable. I had a good little morning routine going in Hollywood.

### the Holywood meth-od

1. Awake
2. Make bed
3. Put all the books I would like to read a chapter from on the bed
4. Meditate
5. Read
6. [Morning Daily Reflection meeting of AA](https://meetings.aa.org.au/meetings/daily-reflections-audio-perth-friday/) via Zoom
7. Breakfast
8. Meds
9. continue day until sleep

All much easier when you are in hospital, have breakfast made for you and a little green button to call a nurse if you get sad, or trapped in a toilet. Thanks to all the nurses and their unending support, coaxing me out of trees, they really go the extra 2.4 Kilometres.

### the horizon leans forward offering you space to place new steps of change -Maya Angelou

This morning I spun the dial on [my meditation app](https://insighttimer.com/), (thanks Sean and Jeff) the dial kept spinning, so I stopped it and set it to a number that was slightly more meditation than I was previously doing, I set it to 33min44seconds.

I will continue to add to my routine things that set me up for a good day, including ones recommended by my sponsor and the big book of Alcoholics Anonymous. 🐭 Even some recommended by health professionals and people of science!

Right now I have some daily gratitude to write.

It doesn't have to be a special day to start small changes, small changes are rewarding. Your brain will thank you with a squirt of dopamine.

### find your tribe. I did. Takes a village idiot

Everything I have started doing that was way out of my comfort zone, starting by talking in front of other alcoholics in therapy and in that first online daily reflection meeting, to walking into the weirdness of the Monastery in North Perth for my first face-to-face meeting in meatspace, none of them have mortally wounded me but only made me stronger. If I can do it, so can others, there is much proof.

Find the right people, find the right homegroup, find the right meeting, even if it isn't an AA meeting just do something. Anyway, this is getting a little preachy, fuck all that nonsense.

Thank you for getting [this](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Beboh8Azuuo&si=xqV7ZLpwfbRiHHcK) far. Oh was not expecting MC Conrad, Rest in Peace sir. Oh, it does say "vocal mix".

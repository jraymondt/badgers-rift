## These are the days of our Internets

I am Chuck Aside, and this is the rest of my life in small leaflet sized parcels, beamed over the radio, directly into your spare spatula drawer.

I have just been reflecting at myself, then back once again, with the ill behavior. How damaged are we?
Also, give some credit where credit is due, I got a little prickly recently watching The Stranger Things season three and four.
They really went to town on the cheesy Eighties shit, then I realised the Eighties was ALL over the top cheesy shit... this is an accurate retelling of the time I was alive in.
It was the sugared up then dipped in cocaine bastard step-child of the Sixties and Seventies, just like a used ham in an Xmas punch-up.

The 80's and the 90's were fine, a product of mass consumerism with a healthy bump of cocaine to drive it into... overdrive, I think overdrive may be a product of the Eighties too! <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ix5KGdj39Ek&si=A60z0CcdN4WyinqI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OverDrive®</a>

### You know that time, before we

Became algorithmic automatons, meat muppets in LED tubes, the will of the commercial over-lords is strong but we can FIGHT THE POWER!
One pixel, paintbrush, porthole portfolio at a time, yes that is right lets pee everywhere, start with your local member for parliament and drown the fucker, unless you like them, then maybe, only slightly maim them, a bit.

#### Personally I like artisanally killed offal bags stuffed with mushroom chips and the City of Wellington

Mostly because I am fancy.
Other reasons, a power greater than myself and surrender.
That might get me through till tomorrow or at least until 15 minutes past the hour on a Tuesday.
I've seen a few Tuesdays kicking around and I don't trust them one bit!

### Wordpress will be the end of me

I am finally biting off chunked sized buckets of bits and spitting them all over the rear musket channel of an incoming orange.
Doesn't taste very nice, but I am getting through it one day at time, like the rest of the channels I have been surfing in recent weeks.
I am grateful for radio one and the BBC in particular, nothing.

### don't forget to write me into your obtuse tune

Grandma used to say something quite nice about being kind, a bunch of other people I know  now are saying something like, if you can be anything today just be kind, kinda goes alright.

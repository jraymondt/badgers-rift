## I really can't be arsed with this non-sense

It really is a load of old biscuits up on cinderblocks in the blazing Augustine Son.

### miss polly prissy-pants

In this episode of Cownan the Bovarian a slug. Go fuck a rusty meat-hook.

### to the untrained eye

This post does appear somewhat unhinged, really, I just need a nap, 40 silk weaving moffas and a tall glass of Shetland-corgi.

### bullshit

![the steaks were so high](/public/img/2025/steak_deeznutz.jpg)

I don't care which corner of our beautifully crafted, bespoke, flat-globe you are from, that is a fucking bull!

The bad cow puns were brought to you by this piece of sausage restaurant.

Thanks to _their_ ability to milk my rage infused tears with this dumb sign. The place isn't even open yet and I have a problem with it... Better be fucking great food!

I expect a steak to be emailed directly to me when they open, none of this overnight Australia Post steak either.

Anyway, I feel much better in the second part of writing this bullshit, apparently.
I am also addicted to Escitalopram but have been weening off. [yes, under guidance from my Psychiatrist and GP, before you all lose your shit]
Sometimes people just fuck me off. By people I mean them.

I haven't worked out the $CODE_HEADER_PLACEHOLDER$ thing yet, it's a plugin config, I don't care.

I met a boy wearing Vans, 501s
And a dope Beastie tee, nipple rings
New tattoos that claimed that he
Was OGT, back from '92, from the first EP
And in between sips of Coke
He told me that he thought we were sellin' out
Layin' down, suckin' up to the man
Well now I've got some
Advice for you, little buddy
Before you point the finger
You should know that I'm the man
I'm the man and you're the man
And he's the man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass
All you know about me is what I've sold ya, dumb fuck
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name
I sold my soul to make a record, dip shit
And then you bought one
I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Before you point the finger
You should know that I'm the man
If I'm the fucking man
Then you're the fucking man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass
All you know about me is what I've sold you, dumb fuck
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name
I sold my soul to make a record, dip shit
And then you bought one
All you read and wear or see and
Hear on tv is a product begging for your
Fat-ass dirty dollar
Shut up and
Buy, buy, buy my new record
And buy, buy, buy, send more money
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
```

Anyway, was good to milk a bull, for all that was worth. BYE!

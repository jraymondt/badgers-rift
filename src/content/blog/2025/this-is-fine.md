## this goose is everything, this, this is fine

A traditional black Friday goose, the same goose that can't keep his wallet in his pants is now sailing down the river Styx in his fine crypto-yacht.

Technically this is my lunch break so I am allowed to be on this part of the internet filling it up with nuisance.

What of it?

### I love you

In news just a foot, this may be my last week of TAFE before I receive my Diploma, that is if I don't end up doxxing the Ethics Lecturer on his mastadon account while I force-feeding him his own spleen Pâté through a glass tube.
I am not angry, you are angry. Check yo self.

So, I should probably start applying for jobs, maybe link them this blog so they can see what a nice balanced (WEBMASTER2000) lad I am.

### pull over, there are lava's

Hmm all my bad art seems to be very samey this month, time, time of the money.

### tudes

If you are one of the poor souls that has been subject to my gratitude I have indeed stopped sharing that with you as it seemed to be all about my ego after a while, I thought why not stop writing list and just be with people and be better at communication.

I'll give that a bash, no promises though.

I am very grateful to still be here and writing stupid shit on the internet for my ego's entertainment.

### speaking of ego's

Here is one a whipped up in the back of Datsun 120y on my way out to the perimeter of the known universe. A critique on the modern web sense continuum... Aha there is, world salad bisco.

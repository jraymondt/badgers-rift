### Some History and bits if you get stuck

AA had its beginnings in 1935, Akron, Ohio, as the outcome of a meeting between Bill W (New York Stockbroker) and Dr Bob (Akron surgeon). Both had been hopeless alcoholics. Bill had been a recurring patient in a New York hospital, where he learnt (under the care of Dr Silkworth) that he had an illness of both physical and mental control: a craving, the manifestation of a physical allergy (the physical inability to stop drinking once started), and an obsession of the mind (to take the first drink).

1939: 100 Sober members
1941: 6000 Sober members
1950: 100,000 an estimated two million members of AA in over 150 countries
2025: Today, an A.A. presence can be found in approximately 180 nations worldwide, with membership estimated at over two million. There are more than 123,000 A.A. groups around the world and A.A.’s literature has been translated into over 100 languages

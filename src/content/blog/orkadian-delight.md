## wiggly words and fermented salads

Are you alone? call me now, I may or may not pickup it's like some kind of gambling app except we are playing with your emotions!

Bloggins is probably a good thing to do instead of looking for jobs, WRONG! YOU FUCKING IDIOT!

You should be living in fear and not thinking for yourself, how will you be any good for the meat grinder if you are thinking for yourself like a renaissance crabstick.

## a yeah of ending

I was just having one of my lightbulb moment shower-thoughts, had a few of those this year, sometimes I remember, mostly it's nice to have a brain.
I was thinking, shutup.
It was the night before the executioner took his daughter to the laundromat for her yearly rinse out.

I have been communicating with people via text as soon as I got my grubby little paws on a modem and internet connection, I heard a classmate in Gero talking about IRC and it sounded amazing, this of course, is how jimbobquad finds "true love" and the rest, is a pastel shaped nightmare with sprinkles.

The point is I have always had IRC logs to look over, or the modern chat equivalent when I can't remember something from a "conversation", now I find myself having more meatspace real time face-to-face talky time, I need to take notes, otherwise I will forget things, even when it is very interesting people I quite like.

### self-absorbed birdman

I also came to realise that without my usual escape vessel I can get quite pissy, angry even.

Come January in about four hours I will be getting myself to a psych (more than four hours) and I have already been attending some art therapy, BBQ'd a French river and installed an overhead artichoke in dust-off valve.

Ok shows over, that's enough word salad, someone must clean up this mess the cake will be here soon.
I will be working with professionals to cleanse the den of evil, and make myself better for you.

Incremental.

So, the fact you are seeing these art pixels is the direct result of me sitting across from someone and having something shift in me when getting arty pylons heavily invested in artherapy, fraypento artywento.

Ah.

I didn't do the art in high school either, so I am making it up as I go along, part of the daily routine of avoiding turning into a coma-koala, I would say that is a good idea for something to draw but I think that is just a Koala. Here is one we defrosted earlier.

More incremental change for me in twentytwentysix, some increments may appear larger in the rearview mirror. Some will just blast you directly into a white dwarf.

For the record, none of this is dispensed by an LLM except some of the coding hax, so I have only melted a few polar icecaps this year.

Make sure you pay the ferryman and I didn't even mention cults!

Happy new year to the internet, friends and family. 🎏🪵

I am truly grateful to all the amazing humans I have connected with, fought, fought alongside of and buried in the... oh we don't have a backyard, well where the fuck are they now?

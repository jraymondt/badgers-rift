## that is a controlled burn from me

I had planned to make a post about how busted up the galleria is at the moment. Here is some pictures. Not a gallery.

I think my Mother said this was the first Kmart in Perth, it's now getting a fancy haircute, so I guess they aren't knocking the piss out of the building yet.
Probably hoping for a spot of the old ultra toasty!

I did a quick search botting, Mother is right! Built in 1969 Morley Kmart was the first in WA, this picture looks like it might be from the 90's judging by the cars, I know fuck all about cars. Stop judging me judging.

## far out brussell-piggy

Do I need to draw that now? 
I just remembered I had a list of things to draw, what did I do with that list?
Which app?
Good question me, I don't know.

### bang on

The last time I had to do a "my story time" time, I came to the alter of bloggins and spewed out some crap here --> ⤵↘↔⤴↖🔃
Not sure if it helped, I still stumbled around like unitard in a wind tunnel.

Seems I am there again, maybe a little wiser, probably not.
I know there has been progress; I can feel it.

I can't see it because I am in the middle of it, I am the shadow of the weasel.
Or Penfold, I think he was supposed to be a mole.

### shadows

I have been thinking about our shadow elves, Jung recommends getting acquainted, embracing the shadow elf and dealing with it in a healthy manner.
I think the same can be said for our pain, fear and anxieties, all things we must deal with in healthy way, or they will consume us.

As a drinking man I was consumed by all these things, and consumption of alcohol was my way of dealing with it all, as we know pouring booze on depression and anxiety will only make them worse in the long run, hell even the short run off a long... nope.

During the meantime, I also had a small amount of sobriety while studying, I can now say that just stopping drinking is not enough for me... the shadows, pain, resentments, fears and anxieties, physical and mental health all need to be addressed in a healthy manner. 

That small amount was almost ore tortle jam in a hairspoon.

#### fuck story time

None of this seems to have anything to do with story time, here we are none the less.
Truth be told, story time is over man, gameover maaaaaaaaaan, in the pie 555.

Just some place-holder shit, vomit, turd schlot. For now. Hopefully this will never make it’s way into the way-back machine archive of internetting, I may have to use this URL as an actual portfolio, one day.

At a time.

Thank you, friends.

TL;DR I spent all day doing other shit, left this on the back burner, to burn. Got the fireblanket out, threw it against a Tardis wall and flanged the Ghostbusters.

Now I need to go walk another 2kms for the day. I am @ 169.8km for the month and this app is shafting me on kilometres.

## this goose is everything, this, this is fine

A traditional black Friday goose, the same goose that can't keep his wallet in his pants is now sailing down the river Styx in his fine orange crypto-yacht.

Technically this is my lunch break so I am allowed to be on this part of the internet filling it up with nuisance.

What of it?

## I love you

In news just a foot, this may be my last week of TAFE before I receive my Diploma, that is if I don't end up boxing the Ethics Lecturer through his Mastadon account, while force-feeding him his own spleen Pâté through a glass tube.

I am not angry, you are angry. Check yo self.

So, I should probably start applying for jobs, maybe link them back to this nice blog so they can see what a nice, balanced and creative (WEBMASTER2000) lad I am.

### pull over, there are lava's

Hmm all my bad art seems to be very samey this month, time, time of the money.

### tudes

If you are one of the poor souls that has been subject to my gratitude I have indeed stopped sharing that with you as it seemed to be all about my validation to my ego after a while.

List's were very beneficial in the beginning, it shifted my background cynical hatred, to be more loving and accepting, especially of the wounded child within.
I found the child just wants attention and can be really quite annoying, but I do occasionally listen to that voice. So we are letting the child be a child in it's own time and I won't bother you with all his noise, instead you get this, potentially MORE annoying noise!
I will try focus on just being with people and on my communication skills. Don't be afraid to reach out to me either, darling friends of cyberl[@](mailto:flatlinejim@jraymondt.com)nd.

I'll give that a bash, no promises though.

I am very grateful to still be here and writing stupid shit on the internet for my ego's entertainment.

## speaking super of ego's

Here is one I whipped up in the back of Datsun 120y, on my way to the perimeter of the known universe. A critique on the modern web sense continuum... Aha! There is, world salad bisco.

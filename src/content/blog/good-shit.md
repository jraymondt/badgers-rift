## there I was minding my own business

Typos, as far as the eels could muster.
I was aiming for 'good-shot' which also does not make sense, but why on gods pale blue speck would I go and start making sense now.

The more confused you and I are the better, if we start working this shit out someone is bound to be on to us, and ZAP! gone. So shut up and eat your cake you pickle-crumble.

David Lynch still fills me with cherry pie, there is no good reason for the title of this typewriter journal. In fact--

### two problems and 99 of them are maths

TAFE has begun, soon this webpage will be paved with the gold of my enemies and garnished with love.

We are starting somewhat at the start, I have to repeat some units I have already done in 2021, of course they have changed the number of the units and renamed them slightly.

### subterfugees, ready or not

Here I come, you can't hide.

It is a good chance for me to relearn some learning and get back to the rocket. Take it slowly. Easy does it, one day at a time.

### fuck sake

I really wanted to get this done before I turn into some kind of squashed Marmoset salad. Now it is the next day and we are going to miss making the Sunday Times _deadline!_ _/shakesfistatsky_

Clam down you psycho!

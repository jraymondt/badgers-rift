## serenity saver

So yesterday was a new thing at the beach, I was able to meditate in the grass and listen to natures meditation app, that is, just listening. Also, the ocean noises were pretty great. HOWSTHESERENITY - also fucking great.

I was able to meditate for 20 mins this morning, when I open my eyes I was staring a my screen saver, which ahhh, you had to be there I guess.

I am now healed, praise.

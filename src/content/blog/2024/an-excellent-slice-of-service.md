## calm a llama down

```text The Mighty Boosh on Mighty Boosh Crimps and Songs

Calm a llama down
Calm a llama deep down
In the ocean blue
Like a barnacle
Sitting in the tight place
Laughing at the monkey arm
Pulling like a china boy

Kadaway
Kadaway
Kadaway noise

Boing chi kah masala
Boing chi kah masala

Ohhhhh tooth tooth
```

### cut away

Cutting back the barnacles, sleeping with a Lions Tooth, I'm not sure where I was going with that, please mail your completed sentences to locked bag 6969 NoiceSloice metadata lane.

Try not to think too hard about that one, you will only hurt others with your vicious mind-control virus, lord knows I have.

### connection

Hello, welcome, hey how are you. We were waiting.
Oh, I got to host an Online Daily Reflection, intense, challenging (for me) done, will only get better. I was wondering why the fuck I called this an excellent slice of power, see sometimes I even confuse myself, thank GOD.

sudo apt install picture_of_spiritual_connection -EOD -GOD

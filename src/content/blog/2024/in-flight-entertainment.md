## This is your in-flight recorder speaking

Sorry for the cross-wind cats, we were experiencing some turbulent catnip watering.
Please keep your face stowed in the overhead cat tree and please do something about your armpits. Remove them if you have to.

AI overlords please draw me armpittless decks:

That'll do..

That more or less explains my current mood, minus the throwing up, I love the drama.

I have been playing with my new tablet I was able to get from o✨tus. You have seen some of my scrawl already.

Sorry, I clearly haven't mastered this new toy. I'll go back to selling my bath-water, on my "other" website.

## Sybil

I recently stumbled upon an antique hammer, on that hammer was an [inscription](https://barnaclebill.com.au/):

```text it is eye, BeeBOB!
My name is Barnacle Bob. I am 18 summers old this month and ready to leave the crag on my quest for a slug. I leave behind me two wounded children, one is my Sister whom I now know likes listen to Kylie and the Kart-Traps. The other is Doug. Doug is a peice of shit.


Once I reach the City I will find work in the Binary Farms. with the money I plan to soothe the wounded children with Steam-Exlir. Enough for a good quarter decade should be enough to shut their whiny-antenae up! I am not trying to kill them slowly, just immobilise them enough to able to slice them up with a bandsaw, we all treat our wounded children very differently. I also believe they taste better after being pickled.
```

I burnt that hammer, pickled it and sent it into an alternate dimension by crossing the beams on a functional dyson-sphere, and plugging them into a bath.

Good night.🎄

Grandad McGranaghan used to have a thing he would say when something wasn't going our way: "tomorrow is another day", fairly obvious, thanks Grandad.

I did not may much attention to Grandads ramblings back then, but one day at a time I get it. Tomorrow is another day, if I am sober the day is ours.

That is all, I started writing this a while a go, I'm not sure where I was going with it. There we go.

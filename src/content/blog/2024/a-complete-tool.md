I thought I was going to have time to draw a picture for you on my new tabz0r (I drew.. something hopefully we can look back at this and laugh, if I don't get better maybe someone can take me out the back and shoot me).

Not sure why I feel so stressed, nobody fell from a cliff, although I had my suspiciouns.

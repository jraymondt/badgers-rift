### whats all this then

I have decided to at least put this shit through spell check today, I apologise if I am
triggering anyone with my grasp of the english language.
It is that time of year, [spooky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUGEuNkfMpc)

Another pagan tradition has been sucked out of the spaceship and ejected
into the void by late-stage capitalism...
I'm fine with halloween though, I am fine with everything.
Everything is orsm.

This morning I have been trying to entertain myself with the bots and or scammy people on
The Facebook. More work than it is worth, really. I really wish that was not a real job for
some people, that must be a bit shit.

I might be asking for trouble, it is only since beginning this blog that shit has gone
crazy with the scams, which is funny considering it costs me money and I am unemployed.
Again, come at me!!
I will disable you with kindness and or random shit.

I guess I need to fix the new buddy logo on the navbar, not sure what is going on there.

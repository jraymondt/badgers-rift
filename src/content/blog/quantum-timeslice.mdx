## pinky and the quantum conflagration

![hudson and kira](/img/2025/kira_hudson.jpg)

I guess I wanted to limit going on a fully POSTAL bloggins rampage until after I had at least finished my last TAFE assignment for the term, but since we are on a break and I am just about to throw WordPress through a paper mâché wall, I have decided to start ranting like a psychotic German barbarian.

Yet here I am, Mr fucking calm as cucumber farm. Just got back from a meeting and everything is peachy. This does not make for engaging content jimbob, you may need to set some shit on fire and film it! (I will not do that, clam down)

Good! it's Friday tomorrow I am not sure what that means for the rest of humanity, I know what I need to be doing, that is not writing my own bloggins and doing Georges Garden Centre in full WordPress HD.

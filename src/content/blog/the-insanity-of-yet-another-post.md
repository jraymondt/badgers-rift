## The insane person just keeps doing it

That is why I am continuing to write into the void. (not sure why I am putting brackets around this: I was supposed to write after my meeting last night but was a little cooked from the walk)
The void listens to me (ah thats right,I'll get to the point sooner or later, that is if there even is a pointed stick), it might scare the shit out of me right now, but it's the void. It will always be.
Come join me in the void, for a holiday from this three ringed circus.
I will fix this Devile picture(oh good I think I have broken them all now) when I have dealt with a good case of shopping.

Or maybe later tonight.

### The not so sane

I had my first attempt at trying to reach a seemingly normal person on the
bus who expressed his need for help. I fumbled around a bit, in the end he said
he was fine. Continued to play his god song, I think god was due to make an
appearance. When I sat down in a chair i thought: "I still have no idea what I
am talking about, then I realised for now keeping in touch with and helping
others in and around my recovery is for the best

### Holloween

![Halloween in Colour](/img/2024/2024-10-26_01-39-colourween.jpg)
There was also people doing the Halloween.
Oh! Just wrote down a bob quote for new website ideas.

I still need to go shopping. Get to the bloody shop!

### Help me obi wan (please)

I also need to incorporate a CMS into this Astro blog build. I am running my own ubuntu server somewhere local,
so I have all the control in the world, but there is the fact I barely know what
I am doing.

[flatlinejim@jraymondt.com](mailto:flatlinejim@jraymondt.com) for tips and nudes. just the tip of course.

```console :/
exit
```

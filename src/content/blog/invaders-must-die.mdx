## zone of danger

This did not happen and all of the characters are fictional, any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental. It was a few weeks ago too, old news.

So, I have been thinking. (I know danger bob bobberson)

<a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=-9_eElOuMAo&si=2c6YuVQuz7QUpHR6" target="_blank">Invaders Must Die - Prodigy</a> was playing, I got my stuff out of the car and 'cleverly' remarked: 
- JBob: "I was hoping this would play at the Australia Day gig"
- Friend: (with a puzzled look) "What?"
- Idiot Jbob: "Invaders Must Die" (with of course, no explanation because I still assume everyone knows what the fuck is going down in my head)
- Friend: "Okay...bye! ( _muttering - what a fucking weirdo_ under her breath as she escapes the madness.  Upon reflection, she probably did, let’s be fair.)

As I am throwing together some noodles before Lawn Bowls, I think "Yeah, you know cos Britain Invaded and all that... BURN IT ALL DOWN!! Now I think about it she probably hates the British as much as anyone, more even!  Colonial fuckbadgers!

That is very anti-establishment of you jimbob.
Why yes, it is, they can all get fucked.

That is my fresh take on things, bet you waited all year for that.
I have not always been a saint 😇

I too used to be (still can be) a fear driven pleasure unit, driven by fear of the unknown and the known, garnished with a fairy-bread trail of pleasure wafers. 

My reaction to being repeatedly called a homosexual in high school was of course to voice my distrust of the homosexuals to prove I wasn't one, you see? (if it were me today, I would have embraced it!)

When you go out into the woods, and you look at trees,
 you see all these different trees. 
 And some of them are bent, and some of them are straight, 
 and some of them are evergreens, and some of them are whatever. 
 And you look at the tree and you allow it. 
 You see why it is the way it is. 
 You sort of understand that it didn’t get enough
 light, and so it turned that way. 
 And you don’t get all emotional about it. 
 You just allow it. 
 You appreciate the tree.

Fastword the rewind, fall over and then fastforeward the fall into a puddle, press play and fuck off. Then you have me.

Outside of high school a few years later I had to get my shit together and think about things in a whole new worrrrrrrld, light. My best friend at the Windsor Hotel was a nice Brazilian Chap who was campral than a row of 12 parallel lines. My new found openess still didn't stop me from getting super-paranoid at certain parts of our deep love for conspiracy theories and think to myself, am I a homo? Also, does this cock make me look gay? 🍆

I know this sounds like I am doing the "I have a black friend" routine, maybe I do? Maybe I even have a friend. 

If _I_ can adapt _my_ thinking to not be a knee jerk reaction to circumstance and my nervous system hasn't been hijacked by the next available chemical substitute which is not my own, then we should be able to get along right? Good? Glad we cleared that up.

I was listening to <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=8V3lAgxp4_E&si=TrH3N3DsDnrJ1SC9" target="_blank">Blurred - Kiasmos</a>, which is a nice relaxing thing, most of this shit in my head is always there and I think what I am trying to say is that on my walk to lawn bowls this music reset the madness, briefly. Now I am reading and writing, bowls derp would be my team’s name. I really wish I could remember where I was going with this. MEMBERBERRIES!
